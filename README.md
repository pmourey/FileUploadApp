# FileUploadApp
I need a front end UI (HTML?), along with the back end functionality either in python or Shell scripting, where I can upload the files. ( I am comfortable Understanding Python or shell , along with HTML)  Below are the steps: 1) Drop down to Select the Environment ( ex:Development, Test or production) where the files need to be uploaded 2) Based on the Environment we should automatically provide directories to select from to copy the files to 3)Browse and upload files from the desktop 4) Submit to copy the files 5) Display the message successfully copied.  In the background, I would like the files to be uploaded onto my Local Unix machine and a directory based on environment name and from there on ssh or scp to the Environment and directory selected.  Once copied - the files to be deleted from Local Machine and Environment folder  Attached a file on my visualization of the UI.   Thanks in Advance
